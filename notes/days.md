#### Stages of the journey
- Journey follows 2 groups the Elm group is first time - can imagine next time will be different
- Fully fictional - not intended to represent all projects or real developers. One journey.
- Each team chooses a path, has a state of mind at the start and end, completes the activity, reaches the same checkpoint

### Stage 1 - Initial set up
EXCITED js: Dive in start scaffolding (swim across the lake) POWERFUL
GUILTY elm: learn syntax, explore model (wander round the lake slowly) EXCITED
checkpoint: project boilerplate

### Stage 2 - Start to make the things
BORED js: Install some linting and build tools. Argue a little but agree standards. HUFFY
CAUTIOUS elm: Sort out data model and figure out update code EXHILERATED
checkpoint: Agreed struture and have few completed parts

### Stage 3 - Reach the limits of initial model
ANNOYED js: Dead end - meet round the campfire CONFIDENT
CONFIDENT elm: Dead end - meet round the campfire CONFIDENT
checkpoint: Realise need new model

### Stage 4 - Build and polish
EXCITED js: Come across an old cabin and stay there. In the morning they realise the roof is leaking in the corner - but they are dry so they shrug it off. Have a lot of features in MVP GUILTY
EXCITED elm: Build own shelter.  In the morning they admire their shelter. It's a bit rough but perfectly sound. Have less features in MVP CONFIDENT
checkpoint: MVP

### Stage 5 - Try it out/ Show it off
CAUTIOUS js: Realise they don't need some of the features ANNOYED
PROUD elm: Are able to go through the code with client PROUD
checkpoint: Test with users and demo to client

### Stage 6 - Tweak and leads step back a little now the architecture is done
CONFIDENT js: Mess up the css. Can't tweek the 3rd party library. Don't realise they've made a big hole in the wall. SCARED
SCARED elm: Amend the 'shelter' feature with no problems. Good error messages. PROUD
checkpoint: Tweeks and a couple new features

### Stage 7 - Project not been worked on for a while
CONFUSED js: Wander through the underground cave system - many dead ends and rockslides LUCKY
CONFIDENT elm: Have a map and get straight through PROUD
checkpoint: New feature added to mature code base
