## Stages of the journey
- Journey follows 2 groups the Elm group is first time - can imagine next time will be different
- Fully fictional - not intended to represent all projects or real developers. One journey.
- Each team chooses a path, has a state of mind at the start and end, completes the activity, reaches the same checkpoint

### Stage 1 - Initial set up
#### js:
EXCITED Dive in start scaffolding (swim across the lake) POWERFUL
#### elm: 
GUILTY learn syntax, explore model (wander round the lake slowly) EXCITED

**checkpoint:** project boilerplate

### Stage 2 - Start to make the things
#### js:
BORED Install some linting and build tools. Argue a little but agree standards. HUFFY

#### elm:
CAUTIOUS Sort out data model and figure out update code EXHILERATED

**checkpoint:** Agreed struture and have few completed parts

### Stage 3 - Reach the limits of initial model
#### js:
ANNOYED Dead end - meet round the campfire CONFIDENT

#### elm:
CONFIDENT Dead end - meet round the campfire CONFIDENT

**checkpoint:** Realise need new model

### Stage 4 - Build and polish
#### js:
EXCITED Come across an old cabin and stay there. In the morning they realise the roof is leaking in the corner - but they are dry so they shrug it off. Have a lot of features in MVP GUILTY

#### elm:
EXCITED Build own shelter.  In the morning they admire their shelter. It's a bit rough but perfectly sound. Have less features in MVP CONFIDENT

**checkpoint:** MVP

### Stage 5 - Try it out/ Show it off
#### js:
CAUTIOUS Realise they don't need some of the features ANNOYED

#### elm:
PROUD Are able to go through the code with client PROUD

**checkpoint:** Test with users and demo to client

### Stage 6 - Tweak and leads step back a little now the architecture is done
#### js:
CONFIDENT Mess up the css. Can't tweek the 3rd party library. Don't realise they've made a big hole in the wall. SCARED

#### elm:
SCARED Amend the 'shelter' feature with no problems. Good error messages. PROUD

**checkpoint:** Tweeks and a couple new features

### Stage 7 - Project not been worked on for a while
#### js:
CONFUSED wander through the underground cave system - many dead ends and rockslides LUCKY

#### elm:
CONFIDENT Have a map and get straight through PROUD

**checkpoint:** New feature added to mature code base
