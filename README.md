# Healthy code, Happy people
## an Introduction to Elm

Javascript on its own has proven to be too flexible. With rapid growth in the ecosystem - browser runable code is getting cleaner and safer to write, but all this stuff encourages mess. Much of the tooling is only there because we have to tidy up; and because we tend not to remove options, these systems are becoming less accessible to newcomers.

Maybe the building blocks are wrong, maybe html and css and javascript are too hard for us to reason in...

What if I told you there was a delightful language designed specifically for humans to create reliable web apps? A compile to javascript, statically typed, functional framework with incorporated state management and a low barrier to entry.

It’s called Elm and it can probably make your developers (and your clients, and your users) happy.

As a community, we shouldn’t be limiting new engineers to specific frameworks or languages; we should be teaching them transferable concepts and Elm can help us remember that.
